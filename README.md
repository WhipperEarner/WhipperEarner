- I have a Business Marketing Major, and I've taken several roles in my professional arena, from a Retail Entrepreneur to a Business Developemnt Specilaist, encompassiong a UX Generalist role in mostly all my roles, with my buisness degree to truly rely on, until the advent of mainstream UX training.

- 🌱 I’m currently working towards a Front-end Certificaion, and learning ReactJS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which truly engage with the user, for projects that seem a little out of reach.
